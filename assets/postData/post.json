          "Pinewood nematode is a tiny worm-like creature spread from a Monochamus pine beetle, 'sawyer' species. The beetle lay eggs in the bark of pine trees and the bacteria carried by the nematode reacts with endophytic bacteria found in the pine species, attacking bark and accelerating tree decay, causing pine wilt and diminishing the value of the pine. After the nematode attacks, infected trees will display vastly different physical properties, including discolouration, which de-values the timber, and also yellowing pine needles. This makes the tree 'unusable' and causes it to die within a couple of months of infection."

          "<b>Belt Dryers</b>: A typical belt dryer design is highly complex with up to 54 bearings and 8 motors/gearboxes which all wear out over time and have the potential to catch fire if not thoroughly and adequately maintained. The belt itself is a more fragile, expensive-to-replace component, with a complex in-feed arrangement to match; the ability to spread material evenly, along the belt is much more complicated than the FlowDrya system.",
          "<b>On-Floor Dryers</b>: Whilst on-floor drying might appear simple on the surface, these dryers are highly inefficient in several ways. The dryer conceals the air-flow complexity beneath the floor which is required to distribute air consistently across a large area. Operationally complex, most grain on-floor dryers are inadequate for moisture heavy biomass."

          "<b>FlowDrya</b>: Despite having a long service life that can operate for over a period of 8,000 annual operating hours, the FlowDrya may actually only be working for less than 2,000 hours because of its unique stop-start operation. The result is 4x less component wear due to the simple construction and lack of moving parts which offers super low service requirements and maintenance costs. These combine together to extend the lifetime of the dryer.",
          "<b>Belt Dryers</b>: The multiple components running belt dryers work overtime and continuously for every operational hour, which really adds up in high duty cycle situations. All electric motors, gearboxes, bearings and shafts work continuously, in contrast to Stronga's stop-start system, thus wearing out over 4x faster compared to the FlowDrya.",
          "<b>On-Floor Dryers</b>: The service life of on-floor dryers is variable, concrete drying floors have a longer life span than hard wood alternatives but on-floor systems still wear out equipment over time. Along with maintenance and shafts costs, on-floor drying requires more labour intensive unloading and telehandler loading which not only increases labour costs but invokes telehandler wear and operation costs – there are many maintenance costs which must be considered with on-floor dryers.",

Once installed, drying can begin almost immediately after. The Stronga team typically spend two days installing equipment on-site with commissioning taking place when the dryer is setup. Our specialist team stay with the client as material is loaded into the dryer and direct answering any questions on operation and maintenance. Where required, Stronga also offer remote access for remote support, ongoing support and training.",
          "<b>Belt Dryers</b>: Belt dryers are large structures made with hundreds of parts and bolts, these components are never assembled together prior to arriving at the customers work site, this leads to long periods of installation while the whole structure is assembled. Often parts will not fit first time and missing parts are frequently an issue, extending the build time further. After the super structure is bolted together and all complex moving parts are installed, including belts, bearings, motors and conveyor, everything needs to be aligned, making belt dryers a time-consuming and costly installation.",
          "<b>On-Floor Dryers</b>: Due to the nature of the structure, planning permission is often required for the building of on-floor biomass dryers. This extends costs and adds uncertainty to the sales process. Grain type on-floor dryers are building-like structures and the installation process is much the same as constructing a building, with the added complexity of constructing tunnels and under-floor work in such a way to balance airflow. Given all the factors, on-floor biomass drying systems often have the longest installation periods.",

FlowDrya offers 3x lower electrical demand than alternative drying systems; this leads to large financial and carbon savings.",
          "<b>FlowDrya</b>: Electric costs and demands are low due to the stop-start arrangement where the operational use and amount of electric depends on the stroke length. In low moisture removal situations, the dryer may only be running for 20 minutes per hour – thus reducing stress on the machine and keeping electrical costs to a minimum. Additionally, by using residual heat to fulfil biomass drying requirements, FlowDrya becomes one of the most conservative drying systems available.",
          "<b>Belt Dryers</b>: In comparison to FlowDrya, belt dryers have approximately 3-4X greater electrical power demand from the several paddle agitators, motors and gearboxes. Biomass levellers and conveyor motors used to drive the belt increase electrical load requirements significantly. FlowDrya doesn't require these added opportunities to operate effectively.",
          "<b>On-Floor Dryers</b>: Although on-floor dryers have few components, they have a higher reliance on handling and operator involvement. Increased fan back pressures create additional energy requirements which increases electricity costs and electrical parasitic load which is an increasingly expensive commodity. Loaders and telehandlers required with this increased handling mean on-floor biomass dryers have higher service costs, where loader buckets are used for agitation and emptying the store."

FlowDrya's large hopper capacity offers industry-leading pre-drying storage, which significantly extends reloading intervals reducing handling and labour costs. With extension hopper options available, wet material capacities can offer 8x more capacity than comparable belt dryers. At 3am on a Sunday morning, this will matter to you!",
          "<b>Belt Dryers</b>: Most belt dryers have almost no hopper capacity. While some units may have separate in-feed systems, they have a small capacity of circa 5m³ and require a full-time loader and operator to keep the operation moving even during over-night periods.",
          "<b>On-Floor Dryers</b>: Through our research working together with existing on-floor dryer operators, we have seen first-hand that experienced dryer operators spend many hours loading out the floor, attempting to spread the biomass evenly and then after-drying, attempting to mix the material, gingerly when drying is complete. After drying, handlers are required to empty the dryer and store and dry output elsewhere. On-floor operators are aware of the costly series of associations. One client we spoke to was refilling bays every 4 days on average, or 92 times per year, the 'semi-hidden' associated costs are enormous."

This is an especially useful feature for woodchip feedstock, where agitation occurs at a depth between 350-450mm. FlowDrya's full material mixing motion ensures all output material is evenly and thoroughly dried. The PulseWave™ agitation feature prevents any over or under drying issues, inherent in other types of drying system. The animation below visualises the PulseWave™ motion.",
          "<b>Belt Dryers</b>: Belt dryers offer no real agitation of the material. As an inadequate solution, belt dryers employ various types of flickers and cross dryer paddle layers which offer little agitation benefit. In reality, these flickers do very little to mix the material which is thinly distributed across the belt – all they do is contribute to higher electric costs and operational complexity.",
          "<b>On-Floor Dryers</b>: On-floor drying systems offer no material agitation whatsoever. The outcome is a re-condensing 'tombs' effect while the output material is unevenly dried – the top layer is never fully dried whereas the bottom layer is over-dry. Manual agitation is the only choice; this is extremely time consuming and ineffective. Without proper agitation, floor drying is extremely inefficient for energy consumption and evaporation rate."

Operating in the form of strokes per hour, operators can gain real control of output material. Each stroke creates full agitation of the biomass material. Modern, reliable HMI touchscreen controls which are fully self-protecting, intuitive and easy-to-use and they have all the features customers need, including setting key parameters, data and energy logging.",
          "<b>Belt Dryers</b>: Belt dryers usually operate with a thin layer of material on the belt. Operators are required to manage the belt tension and adjust the belt speed according to the biomass moisture content and ambient temperature and humidity variations. This process is often overly complex and harder to operate than FlowDrya's self-protecting design. Additionally, because belt dryers have more components, which include set-in-line type fans, belt sweeper motors and flicker rotors, there is an added control complexity.",
          "<b>On-Floor Dryers</b>: On-floor dryers pose a significant issue; there is no way of 'stopping' the drying process. Open-type on-floor drying systems often over-dry material at the bottom of the biomass pile while under-dried material at the top. Consequently, this process causes large amounts of wasted energy and time, as well as significantly reduced, uneven output.

          "<b>Belt Dryers</b>: Historically, belt dryers have caught fire due to the over-heated bearings or due to plastic belts slipping and heating up. Some belt dryers also use direct flame heat sources which have higher fire risks in the same way drum dryers do. Polymer belts have an inherent problem causing static electricity which has consequences relating to electric discharge. Many belt dryer manufacturers have sought to reduce this risk by installing anti-static polymer belts, however, it is not clear how effective these are. Due to frequent belt dryer fires, insurance companies often require the owner to install expensive fire suppression systems which further add to the service requirements, maintenance costs and overall capital outlay.",
          "<b>On-Floor Dryers</b>: With very little control over the drying process, operators often unintentionally over-dry material, especially close to floor-level; historically this has caused devastating fires. Additionally, loader buckets scraping the floor create sparks in biomass due to friction and, once a fire has ignited in the on-floor building, it spreads rapidly and is difficult to control. Many clients often under-estimate the risks of on-floor drying fires. Stronga have been approached by many clients after such fires, to install fire-resilient, continuous drying systems."

Deeper drying with full agitation means that FlowDrya can be more compact than like-for-like belt dryers. FlowDrya can be scaled to suit parameters, including sizing the dryer for residual heat loads and amounts of kW/h/th available. Physical land space has become increasingly valuable and expensive – a compact modular biomass drying solution suits clients with space limitations. The FlowDrya system is a hit with small-scale operations in particular, looking to conserve valuable land.",

Physical commercial space is often at a cost premium; this can be a key deciding factor for some clients.",

Small fines pass through the main open floor and are collected in the sub-floor plenum and carried out into a separate container, away from the main output material. The type and size of 'fines' depend on the input material.",

The European bark beetle is known as the 'spruce bark beetle' (Ips typographus) and this species predominantly causes damage to spruce and pine trees. Other species include the 'mountain pine beetle' (Dendroctonus ponderosae) and the 'great spruce bark beetle' (Dendroctonus micans).",
          "All species of bark beetle are highly reproductive and can have a life cycle of 12-18 months. They burrow into tree bark where they lay eggs in 'galleries'. Larvae from these eggs feed on the internal trunk wood layers, which reduces the nutrients and disrupts the tree's flow of water, in some cases leaving the tree with only a 20% survival chance. Female bark beetles can generate as many as 300 eggs – leading to a population explosion which causes catastrophic destruction to forests."

The optimum moisture level for the fuel depends on boiler type and specification. Matching fuel supply with the boiler specification is extremely important for boiler efficiency, maintenance and output – typically, boilers require 10% moisture content for optimal outcomes. Using a biomass wood fuel with too high a moisture content for the boiler causes a number of operational issues, including: low thermal output, increased emissions from the fuel, significantly increased maintenance and lower reliability with more breakdowns.",

          "When setup in 'batch-mode', the Vessa steam pasteurisation process from start to finish is as follows;",
          "1. Unsterilized material (post anaerobic digestion fibre, cow/poultry manure or other blends) is loaded into the top infeed conveyor of FlowSteama's 'dirty' side. Once the hopper has been 'plugged' with dirty material, pasteurisation can begin",
          "2. Super-heated low-pressure steam (200°C) flows into the insulated, twin-tier vessel from the SteamBoila in an efficient energy exchange. Once the material becomes fully saturated with superheated steam, the SteamBoila automatically modulates down, minimising energy used",
          "3. As steam engulfs the vessel, it quickly and fully penetrates the material which is agitated and mixed on both decks by the hydraulic 'PulseWave™' floor design. Once the batch is fully loaded, the process pauses for the programmed period to achieve the required 'time-at-temperature'. Superheated steam remains in the vessel during the time-at-temperature batch process. The design of the FlowSteama ensures complete and rapid steam penetration of the material in the vessel. If digestate fibre is input for pasteurisation – the load can be pasteurised at a minimum of 70°C for the required duration",
          "4. During the pasteurisation period, temperature logging functions operating, reporting via several sensors on the HMI and control system. FlowSteama's smart, self-protecting logging systems allow operators to evidence and prove time-temperature parameters have been met – this is especially important when dealing with animal-derived products",
          "5. The pasteurised or 'clean' material self-empties from both moving floors in operation, discharging into the lower cross-feed auger on the 'clean' side. Heat treated material can now be safely conveyed and stored in a suitable, clean-side store. With digestate fibre input, each batch's output can be approximately 6 tonnes* – this figure depends on bulk density, initial moisture, particle size and other variables."

It is estimated that the reductions are anywhere between 50-70%, making the final crop undesirable for customers and businesses that look for products with high levels of THC. The viroid causes stunting disease and stunting growth which both affect the overall crop. Usually spread through infected plant sap, cloning, seeds and water, the pathogen thrives on poor sanitation techniques, producing copies of the viroid and spreading through the whole crop. Hop Latent Viroid uses up the plant's energy and significantly reduces the crop's value, restricting the cannabinoids the plant can produce.",
          "Although there is a consensus about how to deal with Hop Latent Viroid and specific testing is beneficial, research shows heat treatment to be an effective solution in reducing the level of viroid. FlowSteama gives the client control over their yield and crop quality while also allowing them to reuse their growing substrate multiple times. Whilst also being organic and pesticide-free, steam heat treatment is historically proven in pasteurizing substrates. It removes all harmful pathogens whilst even helping limit the harmful effects of Hop Latent Viroid. Incubation of Hop Latent residues at temperatures of 70°C indicate a dramatic reduction of the viroid in affected crop after 1 day, and should be used as a pre-treatment method in order to reduce potential future costs and losses. Stronga's heat treatment systems comfortably reach temperatures of 80°C and are therefore highly capable of eliminating the viroid, reducing losses and increasing profits."

Wood gasification provides a valuable alternative to fossil fuel usage, reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and sustainable and independent energy production.",

There are multiple steps involved in ensuring the gasification provider provides electricity, heat and power, as well as its desired fuel output, wood-gas/syngas. These steps include pre-drying the fuel using Stronga's FlowDrya system, pyrolysis, oxidation, gasification and reduction. The heat from the generator, syngas output and flue gas can all be used for heat, power, electricity and energy usage through CHP production. These outputs can be used in a range of non-renewable fossil fuels to power engines and biomass-driven systems.",

          "Global energy security is fragile; recent conflict and disruptions to shipping have only inflated prices further. Rising costs have only reiterated the importance of becoming self-reliant with local energy production. Gasification is available in different scales and it allows business owners to achieve in-house energy security. What's more, it uses available resources that would likely only have gone to waste (woodchips, arb chip, crop residues and manures) to produce self-sufficient renewable heat, power and energy via CHP heat exchange methods and gasification.",
          "The dried fuel input (wood chip/crop residues etc.) can be sold to energy production plants before gasification as input fuel, or alternatively, after gasification. After gasification, the bio-fuel output can be retained to power local communities or used within the local-scale gasification process to contribute towards the operators own circular energy economy. It can also power on-site equipment and internal combustion engines. When wood-gas/syngas is used in place of a gasoline/petrol run engines, the emissions are far cleaner."

After accounting for importation and handling, the mix goes through a long production process in which other materials are added to the blend, adding to the risk that new weeds and bacteria, spores and other pathogens harmful to hemp could be introduced. 'Pseudomonas Aeruginosa' is a particularly problematic bacteria in that it can cause infection in immunosuppressed patients. Whilst the client hadn't seen production quality suffer before release, the FlowSteama helped to alleviate concerns about this particular bacterium which is highly sensitive to heat.

Spread can be easily prevented with a well-proven steam heat treatment process. However, instead of risking contamination between crops and soils, growers often reduce their produce yield and focus on one variety of seed, restricting their profits and actually increasing the risks associated with their reduced growing operation. Less seeds to start out with will already result in less produce, without accounting for the chance of disease and infestation wiping out this reduced operation entirely."

          "Japanese Knotweed (Fallopia Japonica) is widely considered as one of the most invasive and disruptive weeds to ever exist. However, despite the universal acknowledgment that Japanese Knotweed is a major problem to existing and future ecosystems, it still continues to cost businesses excessively, both financially and environmentally.",
          "Japanese Knotweed is spread through transportation, including through fragment dispersion and soil movement, which results in catastrophic costs and destruction to existing vegetation, structures and property. Unnecessary waste, through the disposal of infected soil and valuable topsoil. At Stronga, we produce steaming solutions designed to reliably, efficiently and economically heat treat soils, eradicating Japanese Knotweed from the soil. Read on to find out how client's partnering with Stronga can steam weeds away and return the soil load to its clean, virgin state."

          "While Japanese Knotweed is a global issue, in the UK, local regulations and 'Wildlife and Countryside Acts' aim to prevent further spread and destruction. Japanese Knotweed is commonly defined as 'controlled waste', this means it is an essential requirement that soil or infected materials is disposed of properly and does not cause further infestation.",
          "These rules and examples have been highlighted to try and draw attention to the extent of the Japanese Knotweed problem and the power it has over the farming and food industries worldwide. However, there are more benefits to just simply getting rid of a weed that destroys properties, local wildlife and is responsible for tonnes of soil contaminated waste every year."

In Europe alone, excavated soils are the biggest source of waste. With this and the global topsoil crisis in mind, we have a collective responsibility to try and reuse the millions of tonnes of soil disposed of each year, especially when it can be very easily and safely decontaminated and reutilised through the employment the Stronga FlowSteama. Steam heat treated material can then be sold into the growing sector for growers to produce healthy grown products in clean, weed-free, sterilised soil.",

The Royal Horticultural Society also states their disapproval of their use. What's more, the chemical treatment process can take a long period of time to fully work. The removal of Japanese Knotweed can take at least three seasons to remove in its entirety when using chemical weed killer.",

In contrast to conventional 4-point suspensions, Stronga's robust and reliable 3-point Hydraulic Suspension doesn't produce internal torsion forces. Instead, customers choosing Hydraulic Suspension enjoy the benefits of an extremely long service life, even in the toughest conditions, carrying the heaviest loads.",

The outcome is a smoother, more balanced ride with less stress on the components of the hook trailer.",
          "(3) What's more, large articulation of the axle and suspension leads to reduced towing forces which are especially improved in boggy, muddy conditions, overall reducing the risk of getting stuck. The ability to raise the suspension over undulating terrain is a huge benefit, offering high ground clearance when the terrain gets tough."

This benefit is enabled by the significant travel of the suspension, together with the free swivel motion of the unique 3-point design. What's more, the suspension's revolutionary roll-stability allows fully laden hook trailers to be transported at higher-than-normal speeds in difficult conditions.",

          "(3) Manually setting the suspension to a super low ride height on the road, using the SystaMatic™ remote control, offers significant improvements in stability and speed.

Steam sterilisation offers a rapid turnaround time where growing substrates can be replanted only a few days after heat treatment, while there is also no risk of chemical fumes damaging nearby crops or harming humans as the process is clean and chemical free.",

          "There are a few conditions which are important to consider and observe before heat treating peat-free composts: (1) The growing substrate must not be too wet; the drier it is, the better (up to a point), (2) Whilst the FlowSteama will mix and tumble compost during the heat treatment process, larger lumps can cause slower transmission of steam into the centre of the lump, therefore friable material is heat treated more evenly and quickly, (3) Larger substrates require less kg of steam per kg and therefore are more economic to heat treat.",
          "Once the above conditions have been observed, hygiene awareness then needs to be considered. Compost can be transferred using a 'dirty-side' loading bucket into the FlowSteama hopper. It is vital that the operator handles the contaminated and heat-treated 'clean-side' substrates with different loaders to avoid cross-contamination."

In moist compost, a temperature of 65°C for 10 minutes is sufficient to kill most pathogens and pests. However, some pathogens are more difficult to kill by heat than others. A higher temperature of up to 90°C is needed to treat fungi protected in woody stem bases or roots.",
          "The benefit of Stronga heat treatment systems are their ability to record the temperature profile of the material at several points of the processed steamer, including in the input and output compost temperatures. Temperature profiles of the product are plotted in real-time on the HMI touchscreen, this data can be exported in .CSV format to evidence the heat treatment process. Another benefit of the FlowSteama system is that the residency time of the material inside the vessel can be adjusted by altering the number of \"strokes per hour\". This gives the operator full control of the soil steaming process."

          "After steaming your peat-free compost, good aftercare is of great importance. It is generally advisable to leave the compost to rest for up to a week to allow excess steam to evaporate naturally, reducing moisture content back to its original level. When you do get around to planting again, do not overload the compost with water; start with small watering sessions and gradually build them up.",
          "Moreover, when heat treating compost to the high temperatures required for sterilisation, practically all organisms die, including the beneficial ones. Killing microorganisms diminishes the biological activity which will affect the health of your growing media and potentially your subsequent planting sessions. It is therefore advisable to revitalise your compost after treatment using beneficial microorganisms such as compost activators."

          "Through our work with leading fleet-owning road building contractors across the globe, Stronga have learnt that Air Suspensions require significantly less maintenance than traditional steel Sprung Suspensions. Owners and operators benefit from significantly less wear and tear on the suspension system and associated components (axles, bearings and so on).",
          "Part of the reason for this is that Air Suspensions actively compensate for potholes and road bumps, extending the service life of your trailer whilst minimising the expensive maintenance costs associated with Sprung Suspensions. Ease the burden of lifetime service costs by making the smart investment in professional-level, air damping technology for your new DumpLoada.",
          "The reasons for lower maintenance costs are:",
          "● Fewer wearing parts in air-ride suspensions. Metal Sprung Suspensions have more pins, more bushes and more wearing movement with rocker beam oscillation and spring hangers.",
          "● Air Suspension parts have lower dynamic wearing movement. This leads to increased service life and uptime which is so important for professional operators who need high percentage equipment with maximum uptime.",
          "● On the infrequent occurrence that there is a fault with the Air Suspension, you are normally able to continue driving back-to-base before service is required. You'll generally always be able to return the equipment home.",
          "● After long service at end of life, component exchange is faster and simpler on Stronga air-ride suspensions. Air Suspension parts are far easier to replace than Sprung Suspension parts. That means you can get up and running again faster – especially with BPW's leading global parts support service.",
          "● There are fewer lubrication points on Air Suspensions. Unless Metal Sprung Suspensions are frequently lubricated on all grease points, they are at greater risk of premature wear, requiring replacement."

The benefit of the FlowSteama is its ability to record in real-time the temperature profile of the material at 5 points of the in-vessel steamer: (1) input material, (2) and (3) mid-flow material, (4) and (5) both drop points, (5) output material. Temperature profiles of the product are plotted in real-time on the HMI touchscreen; this data can be exported to CSV format to evidence the heat treatment process.",

The photo on the left shows longitudinal boards with gaps in between the boards to allow muck to fall through. The photo on the right shows cross-boarded decking over a metal platform. This flatbed also has carefully positioned mounting points on the platform for loading special equipment."
