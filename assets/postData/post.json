          "Pinewood nematode is a tiny worm-like creature spread from a Monochamus pine beetle, 'sawyer' species. The beetle lay eggs in the bark of pine trees and the bacteria carried by the nematode reacts with endophytic bacteria found in the pine species, attacking bark and accelerating tree decay, causing pine wilt and diminishing the value of the pine. After the nematode attacks, infected trees will display vastly different physical properties, including discolouration, which de-values the timber, and also yellowing pine needles. This makes the tree 'unusable' and causes it to die within a couple of months of infection."

          "<b>Belt Dryers</b>: A typical belt dryer design is highly complex with up to 54 bearings and 8 motors/gearboxes which all wear out over time and have the potential to catch fire if not thoroughly and adequately maintained. The belt itself is a more fragile, expensive-to-replace component, with a complex in-feed arrangement to match; the ability to spread material evenly, along the belt is much more complicated than the FlowDrya system.",
          "<b>On-Floor Dryers</b>: Whilst on-floor drying might appear simple on the surface, these dryers are highly inefficient in several ways. The dryer conceals the air-flow complexity beneath the floor which is required to distribute air consistently across a large area. Operationally complex, most grain on-floor dryers are inadequate for moisture heavy biomass."

          "<b>FlowDrya</b>: Despite having a long service life that can operate for over a period of 8,000 annual operating hours, the FlowDrya may actually only be working for less than 2,000 hours because of its unique stop-start operation. The result is 4x less component wear due to the simple construction and lack of moving parts which offers super low service requirements and maintenance costs. These combine together to extend the lifetime of the dryer.",
          "<b>Belt Dryers</b>: The multiple components running belt dryers work overtime and continuously for every operational hour, which really adds up in high duty cycle situations. All electric motors, gearboxes, bearings and shafts work continuously, in contrast to Stronga's stop-start system, thus wearing out over 4x faster compared to the FlowDrya.",
          "<b>On-Floor Dryers</b>: The service life of on-floor dryers is variable, concrete drying floors have a longer life span than hard wood alternatives but on-floor systems still wear out equipment over time. Along with maintenance and shafts costs, on-floor drying requires more labour intensive unloading and telehandler loading which not only increases labour costs but invokes telehandler wear and operation costs – there are many maintenance costs which must be considered with on-floor dryers.",

Once installed, drying can begin almost immediately after. The Stronga team typically spend two days installing equipment on-site with commissioning taking place when the dryer is setup. Our specialist team stay with the client as material is loaded into the dryer and direct answering any questions on operation and maintenance. Where required, Stronga also offer remote access for remote support, ongoing support and training.",
          "<b>Belt Dryers</b>: Belt dryers are large structures made with hundreds of parts and bolts, these components are never assembled together prior to arriving at the customers work site, this leads to long periods of installation while the whole structure is assembled. Often parts will not fit first time and missing parts are frequently an issue, extending the build time further. After the super structure is bolted together and all complex moving parts are installed, including belts, bearings, motors and conveyor, everything needs to be aligned, making belt dryers a time-consuming and costly installation.",
          "<b>On-Floor Dryers</b>: Due to the nature of the structure, planning permission is often required for the building of on-floor biomass dryers. This extends costs and adds uncertainty to the sales process. Grain type on-floor dryers are building-like structures and the installation process is much the same as constructing a building, with the added complexity of constructing tunnels and under-floor work in such a way to balance airflow. Given all the factors, on-floor biomass drying systems often have the longest installation periods.",

FlowDrya offers 3x lower electrical demand than alternative drying systems; this leads to large financial and carbon savings.",
          "<b>FlowDrya</b>: Electric costs and demands are low due to the stop-start arrangement where the operational use and amount of electric depends on the stroke length. In low moisture removal situations, the dryer may only be running for 20 minutes per hour – thus reducing stress on the machine and keeping electrical costs to a minimum. Additionally, by using residual heat to fulfil biomass drying requirements, FlowDrya becomes one of the most conservative drying systems available.",
          "<b>Belt Dryers</b>: In comparison to FlowDrya, belt dryers have approximately 3-4X greater electrical power demand from the several paddle agitators, motors and gearboxes. Biomass levellers and conveyor motors used to drive the belt increase electrical load requirements significantly. FlowDrya doesn't require these added opportunities to operate effectively.",
          "<b>On-Floor Dryers</b>: Although on-floor dryers have few components, they have a higher reliance on handling and operator involvement. Increased fan back pressures create additional energy requirements which increases electricity costs and electrical parasitic load which is an increasingly expensive commodity. Loaders and telehandlers required with this increased handling mean on-floor biomass dryers have higher service costs, where loader buckets are used for agitation and emptying the store."

FlowDrya's large hopper capacity offers industry-leading pre-drying storage, which significantly extends reloading intervals reducing handling and labour costs. With extension hopper options available, wet material capacities can offer 8x more capacity than comparable belt dryers. At 3am on a Sunday morning, this will matter to you!",
          "<b>Belt Dryers</b>: Most belt dryers have almost no hopper capacity. While some units may have separate in-feed systems, they have a small capacity of circa 5m³ and require a full-time loader and operator to keep the operation moving even during over-night periods.",
          "<b>On-Floor Dryers</b>: Through our research working together with existing on-floor dryer operators, we have seen first-hand that experienced dryer operators spend many hours loading out the floor, attempting to spread the biomass evenly and then after-drying, attempting to mix the material, gingerly when drying is complete. After drying, handlers are required to empty the dryer and store and dry output elsewhere. On-floor operators are aware of the costly series of associations. One client we spoke to was refilling bays every 4 days on average, or 92 times per year, the 'semi-hidden' associated costs are enormous."

This is an especially useful feature for woodchip feedstock, where agitation occurs at a depth between 350-450mm. FlowDrya's full material mixing motion ensures all output material is evenly and thoroughly dried. The PulseWave™ agitation feature prevents any over or under drying issues, inherent in other types of drying system. The animation below visualises the PulseWave™ motion.",
          "<b>Belt Dryers</b>: Belt dryers offer no real agitation of the material. As an inadequate solution, belt dryers employ various types of flickers and cross dryer paddle layers which offer little agitation benefit. In reality, these flickers do very little to mix the material which is thinly distributed across the belt – all they do is contribute to higher electric costs and operational complexity.",
          "<b>On-Floor Dryers</b>: On-floor drying systems offer no material agitation whatsoever. The outcome is a re-condensing 'tombs' effect while the output material is unevenly dried – the top layer is never fully dried whereas the bottom layer is over-dry. Manual agitation is the only choice; this is extremely time consuming and ineffective. Without proper agitation, floor drying is extremely inefficient for energy consumption and evaporation rate."

Operating in the form of strokes per hour, operators can gain real control of output material. Each stroke creates full agitation of the biomass material. Modern, reliable HMI touchscreen controls which are fully self-protecting, intuitive and easy-to-use and they have all the features customers need, including setting key parameters, data and energy logging.",
          "<b>Belt Dryers</b>: Belt dryers usually operate with a thin layer of material on the belt. Operators are required to manage the belt tension and adjust the belt speed according to the biomass moisture content and ambient temperature and humidity variations. This process is often overly complex and harder to operate than FlowDrya's self-protecting design. Additionally, because belt dryers have more components, which include set-in-line type fans, belt sweeper motors and flicker rotors, there is an added control complexity.",
          "<b>On-Floor Dryers</b>: On-floor dryers pose a significant issue; there is no way of 'stopping' the drying process. Open-type on-floor drying systems often over-dry material at the bottom of the biomass pile while under-dried material at the top. Consequently, this process causes large amounts of wasted energy and time, as well as significantly reduced, uneven output.

          "<b>Belt Dryers</b>: Historically, belt dryers have caught fire due to the over-heated bearings or due to plastic belts slipping and heating up. Some belt dryers also use direct flame heat sources which have higher fire risks in the same way drum dryers do. Polymer belts have an inherent problem causing static electricity which has consequences relating to electric discharge. Many belt dryer manufacturers have sought to reduce this risk by installing anti-static polymer belts, however, it is not clear how effective these are. Due to frequent belt dryer fires, insurance companies often require the owner to install expensive fire suppression systems which further add to the service requirements, maintenance costs and overall capital outlay.",
          "<b>On-Floor Dryers</b>: With very little control over the drying process, operators often unintentionally over-dry material, especially close to floor-level; historically this has caused devastating fires. Additionally, loader buckets scraping the floor create sparks in biomass due to friction and, once a fire has ignited in the on-floor building, it spreads rapidly and is difficult to control. Many clients often under-estimate the risks of on-floor drying fires. Stronga have been approached by many clients after such fires, to install fire-resilient, continuous drying systems."

Deeper drying with full agitation means that FlowDrya can be more compact than like-for-like belt dryers. FlowDrya can be scaled to suit parameters, including sizing the dryer for residual heat loads and amounts of kW/h/th available. Physical land space has become increasingly valuable and expensive – a compact modular biomass drying solution suits clients with space limitations. The FlowDrya system is a hit with small-scale operations in particular, looking to conserve valuable land.",

Physical commercial space is often at a cost premium; this can be a key deciding factor for some clients.",

Small fines pass through the main open floor and are collected in the sub-floor plenum and carried out into a separate container, away from the main output material. The type and size of 'fines' depend on the input material.",
