          <p class="section-description">
            Unplanned downtime has impacts beyond cost, often extending to those dependent on the output of your
            FlowDrya. That’s why we’ve built a dryer which is simply the most reliable solution available in the market.
            Hard-wearing parts, no belts, chains and sprockets and powerful hydraulic components ensure excellent uptime
            and long service life. Conversely, moving belt type dryers are complex with numerous parts moving and
            wearing out. The belt has to be frequently cleaned. It can slip, stretch and be damaged by certain objects,
            leading to costly and lengthy downtime. If you want a dryer that is cost-effective, purpose-built and super
            reliable to run; look no further than FlowDrya.

            Every Stronga product is designed to comply with our core principle of building simple, reliable,
            easy-to-operate machines. The FlowDrya continuous dryer positively moves wet materials from a hopper (end

            quality air, fed from a variety of efficient, optimised heat sources. Simplicity is paramount with FlowDrya.

          <p class="video-subtitle">Optimal airflow injection</p>
          <p class="video-text">
            FlowDrya is able to rapidly raise materials to an evaporative temperature because drying occurs in 2 ways;
            through (1) air drying and; (2) thermal conduction. Injecting drying quality air through wet materials as
            they roll, tumble and flow along the hydraulic bed optimises the evaporative drying process to reduce
            moisture content evenly to the client’s requirements. Learn the process.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              (1) Drying quality air is delivered by the Heatex unit. Heatex can utilise multiple heat sources,
              including; low grade residual process heat; CHP engine, water jacket and flue gas heat; biomass boiler
              thermal output; & more.
            </span>
            <br>
            <span>
              (2) Warm airflow heats the insulated steel structure of the FlowDrya sub-floor plenum, conducting thermal
              energy directly into materials on the drying bed to the supplement air drying process.
            </span>
            <br>
            <span>
              (3) Warm air rises through the ventilated floor and through the material. Full length diffusion with
              intelligent zoning of airflow optimises drying efficiency as the material changes state from wet to dry.
            </span>
            <br>
            <span>
              (4) Saturated exhaust air dissipates into the atmosphere via suitably-sized flue ducting, or can be
              recirculated via modern, well-designed energy-recovery systems.

          <p class="video-subtitle">PulseWave™ mixing motion</p>
          <p class="video-text">
            FlowDrya’s unique selling point is PulseWave™ - the automatic agitation of materials as they are
            continuously tumbled along the moving floor. PulseWave™ ensures that every part of the material receives
            even thermal conductive contact with the hot drying bed, leading to uniformity of output dryness.
          </p>
          <p class="video-text">
            During the forward stroke of the moving floor, materials are tumbled forwards by the pushing blade face,
            causing a larger driving force low to the bed. The driving force is weaker above the pushing blade, causing
            materials at the wave’s crest to lag and tumble backwards. In the return stroke, materials are lifted over
            the tilted axis of the blade to form another wave. As the crest height grows, the wave becomes unstable,
            causing materials to tumble forwards and backwards, ensuring full agitation on every stroke. Each stroke,
            materials are displaced from their position which doesn’t occur in belt drying situations; this means that
            each particle receives equal access to warm airflow and thermal conduction during the process.

          <p class="section-description">
            FlowDrya operations are managed by an integrated Programmable Logic Controller which, working in total
            synergy, maximises efficiency and reliability while reducing time and management costs. Low maintenance,
            robust PLC systems integrated and sealed within the dryer have durable infrastructures designed to withstand
            local operating temperature variations. Next-gen FlowDrya controls optimise drying processes to give you
            peace of mind while improving drying efficiency and outcomes. FlowDrya’s automation control systems offer
            safe and secure data logging, enabling operators to analyse key factors and optimise drying operations.

          <p class="section-description">Our experience has taught us that there are many wasted heat sources from flue
            gases to process heat and CHP cooling. We believe that wasted heat should be fully utilised for both
            financial and environmental benefit. To make the most of your spare heat, you need a dryer that leads the
            way in versatility, durability and ease of operation. The following wasted residual heat sources can be
            harnessed by diverting spare heat via heat exchange into FlowDrya, adding value by drying available wet
            material:</p>

            FlowDrya has several in-feed hopper arrangements with capacities to the suit the material, customer's
            requirements, bulk density and moisture to be removed. Through thermal conduction, the in-feed hopper raises
            material towards evaporative temperature before they reach the drying bed while large cubic capacities
            maximise loading intervals. ‘The Other Guys’ require complex in-feed conveyor arrangements which make the

            normally use the on-site energy supply whereas belt dryers typically require an expensive extra energy

            FlowDrya’s powerful hydraulic moving floor pushes materials of all densities and moistures. Stronga create
            “airflow zones” to reduce back pressure and minimise dust which improves drying outcomes. In a moving belt
            situation, the belt has to be constantly cleaned using air, water or mechanical brushes. The belt can slip,
            stretch and be damaged by certain objects, leading to costly downtime. Air zoning is only possible by adding
            complexity, maintenance, energy and cost with even more fans.

          <h2 class="section-title">Comparing drying efficiency</h2>


          <p class="section-description">
            Material in belt dryers is typically slower to reach evaporative temperature because air is the only method
            of drying while the belt provides high air resistance which is detrimental to the drying process. FlowDrya
            offers both thermal hot air and conductive drying via the warm stainless steel drying bed. Conductive drying
            is accelerated by PulseWave™ agitation of the material. All of this means that FlowDrya accelerates material
            to the evaporation phase faster while the combination of agitation and conductive heat optimises drying
            efficiency.

          <p class="section-description">
            Fully agitating the material during the continuous flow process is vital for uniformity and efficient
            optimisation of dry output. FlowDrya’s PulseWave™ moving floor agitates material every single stroke,
            without the costs associated with the belt dryer’s separate agitation paddles. Each belt dryer paddle has an
            associated cost in capital and maintenance terms. They have bearings, shafts, gearboxes and motors which
            have additional electrical cost, plus wearing out in high duty situations and need replacing.
